    MangoThreat(name='Anthracnose', slug='anthracnose', description='Fungal disease causing leaf spots.', image='Anthracnose.png', details='Anthracnose is a group of fungal diseases that affect a wide variety of plants, causing dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits. It thrives in warm, wet conditions and spreads through water, wind, or contaminated tools. Proper sanitation, resistant plant varieties, and fungicide application can help manage and prevent its spread.', threat_type='Disease'),
    MangoThreat(name='Bacterial Black Spot', slug='bacterial-black-spot', description='Bacteria cause black lesions on mangoes.', image='bacterialblackspot.png', details='Bacterial Black Spot is a plant disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, commonly affecting roses and some vegetable crops. It presents as black or dark brown spots with yellow halos on leaves, eventually leading to leaf drop and weakened plant health. The disease spreads through water splashes, wind, or infected tools, and is best managed through proper pruning, sanitation, and resistant plant varieties.', threat_type='Disease'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Scab', slug='mango-scab', description='Fungal infection creates rough fruit patches.', image='mangoscab.png', details='Mango Scab is a fungal disease caused by ElsinoÃ« mangiferae that leads to dark, scabby lesions on young leaves, twigs, and fruit. It can reduce fruit quality and marketability if not controlled early. Good airflow, sanitation, and fungicide sprays help manage the disease.', threat_type='Disease'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Scale', slug='mango-scale', description='Tiny insects suck sap from trees.', image='mangoscale.png', details='Mango Scale refers to small, sap-sucking insects that attach to mango tree bark, leaves, and fruit, weakening the plant. Heavy infestations can lead to yellowing leaves, premature fruit drop, and reduced yields. They can be controlled with horticultural oils, beneficial insects, or systemic insecticides.', threat_type='Pest'),
    MangoThreat(name='Fruit Fly', slug='fruit-fly', description='Larvae feed inside ripening mango fruit.', image='fruitfly.png', details='Fruit flies are major mango pests whose larvae burrow into ripening fruit, causing it to rot from the inside. Infestation makes the fruit unmarketable and leads to significant crop loss. Traps, sanitation, and timely harvesting are effective control strategies.', threat_type='Pest'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Leafhoppers', slug='mango-leafhoppers', description='Insects pierce leaves and transmit diseases.', image='mangoleafhopper.png', details='Mango Leafhoppers are small, jumping insects that feed on mango sap and excrete honeydew, promoting sooty mold growth. They are especially damaging during flowering, as they reduce fruit set. Management includes pruning, insecticides, and controlling their populations early in the season.', threat_type='Pest'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Seed Weevil', slug='mango-seed-weevil', description='Larvae tunnel through mango seed cavity.', image='seedweevil.png', details='The Mango Seed Weevil (Sternochetus mangiferae) is a hidden pest that lays eggs on developing mango fruit, with larvae tunneling into the seed. Though it does not damage the fruit externally, it renders the seed useless and is a quarantine concern. Sanitation and monitoring are key to preventing its spread.', threat_type='Pest'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Twig Tip Dieback', slug='mango-twig-tip-dieback', description='Branches dry and wither from tips.', image='mango-twig.avif', details='This disease has been affecting mango orchards in the NT, leading to the death of young shoots and impacting overall tree health. Recent research has identified the cause, providing hope for effective management strategies.', threat_type='Disease'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Malformation', slug='mango-malformation-disease', description='Abnormal growth distorts shoots and flowers.', image='mango-malformation.jpg', details='Present in the NT, this disease causes abnormal growth of flowers and shoots, leading to reduced fruit yield. It is under official control to prevent further spread.', threat_type='Disease'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Shoot Borer', slug='mango-shoot-borer', description='Caterpillars tunnel into young mango shoots.', image='mango-shoot-borer.jpg', details='Also known as the mango tip borer, the larvae of the moth bore into young shoots, causing dieback and potentially reducing fruit production. It is found in the NT and other parts of Australia.', threat_type='Pest'),
    MangoThreat(name='Mango Gall Midge', slug='mango-gall-midge', description='Larvae form galls on tender parts.', image='mango-gall-midge.jpg', details='Although not currently present in the NT, this pest poses a biosecurity threat. It causes galls on leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced photosynthetic capacity', threat_type='Pest')
